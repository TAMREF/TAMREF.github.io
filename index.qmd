# Bio

Hi! I am an undergraduate student in Department of Mathematical Sciences, Seoul National University, Republic of Korea.

I'm broadly interested in the design and analysis of algorithms, combinatorics, and their applications. Currently, I'm working on **graph algorithms** in parallel and distributed setup, and LP-based approximation algorithms on combinatorial optimization problems.
